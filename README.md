## Introduction\

Real-world data for many machine-learning or data-mining projects are usually high-dimensional or consist of a large number of features which is hard to be managed. To avoid overfitting, wasting time and storage for saving data, and to improve the performance of the machine-learning model, there are some algorithms that scientists use to achieve low-dimensional data out of the original dataset provided that it retains most of the important attributes, called intrinsic, of the main dataset. This transformation is called Dimensionality Reduction (DR). The DR algorithms listed in the project are Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), Landmark ISOMAP [LIM], and Local Linear Embedding [LLE] that will be discussed in the following.
